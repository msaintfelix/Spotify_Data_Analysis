# Spotify_Data_Analysis
EDA and predictions based on 600k songs from Spotify.

The objective of this notebook is to predict the popularity of a song using a 600k song dataset from Kaggle. We will use a mix of categorical and numerical features to perform a multi-linear regression using Scikit-Learn Pipelines. The objective is to minimize the "mean_absolute_error" metric.
