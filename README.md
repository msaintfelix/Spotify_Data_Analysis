# Spotify_Data_Analysis
EDA and predictions based on 600k songs from Spotify.

The objective of this repository is to predict the popularity of a song using a 600k song dataset from Kaggle. We will use a mix of categorical and numerical features from 'tracks.csv' to benchmark several models with Scikit-Learn Pipelines and fine-tune the final model with GridSearchCV. The objective is to minimize the "mean_absolute_error" metric of a numerical target feature.
